I am building a Flask-based Academic Portal web app. The goal is to have a fully functional Faculty Dashboard. Please enhance my existing app with the following requirements and generate a complete app.py with models, routes, and templates:

1. Faculty Dashboard (core functions)

Edit student marks (ensure proper database relationships with ExamResult and Exam).

Upload student data via CSV/Excel (students, exam results, fee data).

Re-upload files to update or overwrite existing records.

Manage Assignments: Add, edit, update, delete, including file uploads.

Manage Exams: Create, update, delete exams with subject, max marks, and date.

Manage Fees: Update records, upload/re-upload fee CSVs, show pending/paid status.

2. Quick Access Buttons

Faculty dashboard must have working buttons for: Upload Students, Manage Exams, Manage Assignments, Manage Fees.

Each button should navigate to functional pages with forms or upload options.

3. File Upload Handling

Allow CSV/Excel uploads for students, exams, and fees.

Use pandas to process files and update the database.

Ensure re-uploads update existing records instead of creating duplicates.

4. Database

SQLAlchemy models: Student, Exam, Assignment, Fee, ExamResult.

Proper relationships (ExamResult → Exam, Assignment → Student, etc.).

Full CRUD support for all models.

5. UI Enhancements

Use Bootstrap for layout and styling.

Ensure all buttons, upload forms, and management pages work.

Show flash messages for success/error.

6. Deployment

App must run smoothly on Replit.

Include requirements.txt dependencies (flask, flask_sqlalchemy, pandas, openpyxl).

File upload folder must work on Replit (uploads/).

Additional Notes:

Do not generate placeholder buttons; every action must perform the described functionality.

Ensure faculty can edit/add/delete assignments, exams, and fees, not just view them.

Implement safe file handling for re-uploads.

Use Flask templates (.html) for all pages.

Generate the full working app.py along with all necessary templates to implement these features.
